# Recipe Web App
This web app runs on Google App Engine and uses the Recipe Puppy Api to create a fun recipe search engine for food. This project was done as a learning tool during LMU's 2019 CSSI program.

Note: Do not edit grid while appserver is running, breaks appserver and requires a hard restart
